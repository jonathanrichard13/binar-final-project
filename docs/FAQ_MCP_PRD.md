# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## FAQ Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

### Version: 1.0

### Date: July 19, 2025

### Target Platform: Claude Desktop Integration

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) that integrates with Claude Desktop to provide intelligent FAQ responses. The system will read user queries, vectorize them, compare against existing FAQ content, and provide responses based on semantic similarity matching with a 75% threshold.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Purpose

Create an intelligent FAQ system that leverages Claude Desktop's MCP capabilities to provide accurate, contextual responses to user queries by matching them against a curated FAQ knowledge base.

### 2.2 Scope

- Read and process FAQ text files from the `/faq` directory
- Implement text vectorization and similarity matching
- Integrate with Claude Desktop via MCP protocol
- Provide intelligent responses with confidence thresholds

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Programming Language

- **Primary Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Integration**: Claude Desktop MCP

### 3.2 Core Dependencies

```python
# Required libraries for initial iteration
mcp>=0.1.0  # Model Context Protocol server library
asyncio>=3.4.3
json>=2.0.9
pathlib>=1.0.1
logging>=0.4.9.6
os>=1.0.0
re>=2.2.1

# Future iterations (not needed for v1.0)
# sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
# numpy>=1.21.0
# scikit-learn>=1.0.0
```

### 3.3 System Architecture

#### 3.3.1 Input Processing Flow

1. **User Query Reception**

   - Receive user input through Claude Desktop interface
   - Validate and sanitize input text
   - Log query for analytics and debugging

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Remove special characters and normalize text
   - Convert to lowercase
   - Handle common abbreviations and synonyms

#### 3.3.2 Content Analysis Process (V1.0 - Chain of Thoughts Approach)

1. **FAQ Content Loading**

   - Load all FAQ text files from `/faq` directory
   - Parse and structure Q&A pairs from each file
   - Maintain file-to-content mapping for source attribution

2. **Claude Chain of Thoughts Analysis**

   - Present user query alongside all FAQ content to Claude
   - Use structured reasoning to compare query against each FAQ file
   - Evaluate semantic relevance and contextual similarity
   - Determine best matching FAQ file through logical reasoning

3. **Relevance Assessment**
   - Claude evaluates if the best match is sufficiently relevant
   - Uses reasoning to determine if the FAQ content adequately addresses the query
   - Makes binary decision: answer from FAQ or "cannot answer"

#### 3.3.3 Relevance Matching Algorithm (V1.0 - Chain of Thoughts)

1. **Content Comparison Process**

   - Present user query to Claude along with all FAQ file contents
   - Claude analyzes each FAQ file's content against the user query
   - Use structured prompt to guide Claude's reasoning process

2. **Decision Making Logic**

   - Claude evaluates topical relevance between query and each FAQ file
   - Identifies the most relevant FAQ file through reasoning
   - Determines if even the best match is sufficiently relevant to the query
   - Returns specific FAQ answer if relevant, or "no answer" if too distant

3. **Structured Reasoning Prompt**

   ```
   Given this user query: "{user_query}"

   Analyze each of these FAQ files and their content:
   [List all FAQ files with their content]

   Step 1: Identify which FAQ file is most relevant to the query
   Step 2: Evaluate if this best match actually addresses the user's question
   Step 3: If relevant, provide the specific answer from that FAQ
   Step 4: If not relevant enough, respond with "cannot answer"
   ```

### 3.4 File Structure and Data Management

#### 3.4.1 FAQ File Processing

```

└── integrations_api.txt
```

#### 3.4.2 Data Storage
