Q: What health monitoring features are included in Vitalynk's free VitalBasic plan?
A: The VitalBasic plan includes essential health monitoring: real-time heart rate tracking through "VitalPulse", daily step counting via "VitalSteps", basic sleep duration tracking using "VitalSleep", and weekly health summaries through our "VitalWeekly" reports. You get data storage for 30 days in our "VitalStorage", emergency contact alerts via "VitalAlert", and basic workout detection through "VitalFit". The free plan supports one wearable device and includes access to our mobile app with community health challenges through "VitalCommunity".

Q: What's the difference between Vitalynk VitalPremium and VitalPro health plans?
A: VitalPremium ($9.99/month) adds advanced sleep analysis with REM/deep sleep stages through "VitalSleep Pro", stress monitoring with breathing exercises via "VitalCalm", detailed workout insights using "VitalFit Analytics", 1-year data history in "VitalArchive", and "VitalFamily" sharing for 2 members. VitalPro ($19.99/month) includes all VitalPremium features plus ECG readings through "VitalECG", blood oxygen monitoring via "VitalOxy", fall detection using "VitalSafety", AI health predictions through "VitalAI Insights", unlimited data history, "VitalCare" telehealth integration, and "VitalFamily Circle" for up to 4 members.

Q: Can I switch between Vitalynk health plans and will I lose my health data?
A: Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade anytime through the app's "VitalSubscription Manager" without losing any health data stored in our "VitalVault" system. When upgrading, new features activate immediately through our "VitalUpgrade" process. When downgrading, you retain VitalPro/VitalPremium features until your current billing cycle ends, but advanced health insights and extended data history may become read-only through our "VitalArchive" system. All core health data (heart rate, steps, sleep) is always preserved regardless of plan changes through our "VitalCore" protection.
