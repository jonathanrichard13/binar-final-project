Q: How does Vitalynk protect my sensitive health data?
A: Vitalynk employs bank-level security with end-to-end encryption for all health data through our "VitalSecure" protection system. We use AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit, maintain HIPAA compliance through our "VitalCompliance" framework, and undergo annual SOC 2 Type II audits. Your biometric data is stored on secure, air-gapped servers with multi-factor authentication through our "VitalVault" system. We're also FDA-registered for medical device data handling under our "VitalMedical" certification.

Q: Who can access my health information and medical data?
A: Only you control access to your health data through our "VitalPrivacy" control center. Vitalynk employees cannot view your personal health information without explicit consent for technical support through our "VitalAccess" permission system. Healthcare providers can only access data you specifically share through our secure "VitalShare" patient portal. We never sell health data to advertisers or third parties under our "VitalPromise" guarantee. All data sharing requires your explicit, revocable consent through our "VitalConsent" management system.

Q: How can I delete my health data and what happens to my medical information?
A: To delete your account and health data, go to Vitalynk app > "VitalSettings" > "VitalPrivacy" > "Delete VitalProfile". This permanently removes all health data within 30 days through our "VitalPurge" system, including backups. For medical research you've consented to through our "VitalResearch" program, data is anonymized before deletion. Emergency medical information may be retained for 7 years per healthcare regulations, but is fully anonymized after account deletion through our "VitalAnonymizer" process.
