## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive FAQ system and analytics platform designed to optimize user support and knowledge management.

### Components

1. **FAQ Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**

   - An intelligent backend that leverages Claude's chain-of-thought reasoning to answer user queries using a structured knowledge base of FAQ files.
   - Features real-time query processing, integration with Claude Desktop, and tools for managing and analyzing FAQ content.

2. **FAQ Analytics Dashboard**
   - A modern web dashboard built with React, Next.js, and Express for monitoring FAQ usage, analyzing query performance, and identifying content gaps.
   - Provides real-time metrics, interactive data visualizations, and seamless integration with the MCP server for end-to-end analytics.

Together, these tools help organizations improve FAQ systems, enhance user experience, and gain actionable insights into user interactions and system performance.
