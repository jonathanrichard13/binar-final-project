# FAQ Analytics System Development Journey

> **Project Overview**: A complete AI-powered FAQ system with Claude Desktop integration and comprehensive analytics dashboard.

## üéØ Phase 1: Foundation & Planning

### 1.1 Initial Concept & Foundation

**The Beginning**: Creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that reads FAQ files and provides intelligent answers.

```
inside folder faq/ make at least 10 dummy faq in the form of txt files. The purpose of those faqs will be to make a model context protocol that reads into those txt files before answering.

After making the faq, make a prd inside docs/ folder about how the MCP will behave, starting from reading the user generated input to vectorizing the input and matching with the txt files. Take one with the highest similarity and answer based on that. But if the highest similarity is still less than 75% then just answer that the question is can not yet be answered. Make the PRD for python code and assume using Claude desktop for the integration
```

### 1.2 Simplifying the Approach

**Strategic Pivot**: Moving from complex vectorization to Claude's natural reasoning capabilities.

```
for the first iteration, no need to add sentence transformer, instead use chain of thoughts in claude. Compare all the dummy files with the question and pick the best file for responding, but if even the best file strays too far, then just say no answer
```

### 1.3 Technical Foundation

**Adding Core Dependencies**: Implementing the essential MCP library for Claude Desktop integration.

```
you forgot the most important library, which is "mcp", below is some snippet code i used before:

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import logging

# Configure logging to output to the console (stdout)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s %(message)s")

def send_log_message(message: str):
    logging.info(message)

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Demo")
send_log_message("Starting MCP server...")
```

## üöÄ Phase 2: Implementation & Configuration

### 2.1 Building the MCP Server

**Development Start**: Creating the core MCP functionality based on the established PRD.

```
proceed to make the MCP based on the PRD
```

### 2.2 Claude Desktop Integration

**System Configuration**: Setting up the MCP server to work with Claude Desktop.

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Demo": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\User\\.local\\bin\\uv.exe",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "D:\\Belajar\\Binar AI\\Assignment 6 MCP\\mcp-server-demo\\main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
Above is my claude config, edit them to use this MCP folder
```

### 2.3 Debugging & Troubleshooting

**Problem Solving**: Addressing integration issues and server errors.

```
the claude is facing error, here is the log file
```

```
i still got error
```

## üè• Phase 3: Content Enhancement & Branding

### 3.1 Domain-Specific Content

**Realistic Branding**: Creating detailed FAQ content for a health monitoring startup.

```
change the faq dummy with a much more detailed and specific. For example about a startup company called Vitalynk which focuses on health monitoring application in wearables
```

### 3.2 Brand Consistency & Testing

**Quality Assurance**: Making the FAQ content distinctive and brand-specific for proper testing.

```
make it even more distinvtive so that i know the MCP server is working properly. For example on account management, about how to reset password, "Open the vitalynk app, tap "Forgot Vital Password". Or when going to the profile, instead call the menu "Vitprofile"
```

### 3.3 Project Organization

**Development Best Practices**: Adding version control and project structure.

```
make a gitignore files
```

## üìä Phase 4: Analytics Dashboard Evolution

### 4.1 Analytics Vision

**Expanding Scope**: Planning a comprehensive analytics system for the FAQ interactions.

```
Make a new PRD for the next project, which is the analytics on questions answered. Make a dashboard using streamlit and good visualizations. Also don't forget to add timeframe filtering
```

### 4.2 Technology Stack Upgrade

**Modern Architecture**: Transitioning to a full-stack solution with Next.js and PostgreSQL.

```
the MCP is now working properly, now please continue to the analytics dashboard, but first update the PRD to also record each questions that can not yet be answered. Also make a dedicated page for that. Also change the tech stack from streamlit to next js and express with the database in postgresql.
```

### 4.3 Documentation Refinement

**Focused Updates**: Clarifying the scope of PRD modifications.

```
what i meant before is only edit the FAQ_Analytics PRD, no need to make a new one
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Phase 5: Database Integration & Data Flow

### 5.1 Database Implementation

**Data Persistence**: Integrating PostgreSQL database for query tracking and analytics.

```
now in the mcp server, whenever a user query, add them to the database, also make the database based on the PRD and the .env
```

### 5.2 Iterative Development Process

**Continuous Progress**: Using agent-based development for seamless iteration.

```
@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"
```

### 5.3 Data Flow Optimization

**Query Tracking**: Ensuring proper data capture at the right point in the process.

```
for the database, save the query passed on to the answer_faq instead
```

### 5.4 Rollback & Refinement

**Iterative Development**: Making careful adjustments to the data flow.

```
revert the last edit
```

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 6: Code Organization & Modularity

### 6.1 Project Restructuring

**Clean Architecture**: Organizing all MCP-related code into a dedicated, modular structure.

```
refactor the code, make a single folder for all the MCP codes. Make it modular also
```

### 6.2 Continued Development

**Iterative Progress**: Maintaining development momentum through agent collaboration.

```
@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"
```

### 6.3 File Cleanup

**Project Hygiene**: Removing obsolete files and maintaining clean project structure.

```
also remove the moved file
```

### 6.4 Final Organization

**Root Directory Cleanup**: Moving all Python files to the dedicated MCP folder for better project organization.

```
also move every py file in to the folder mcp, i want a clean folder in my root directory
```

### 6.5 Final Iteration

**Project Completion**: Ensuring all components are properly organized and finalized.

```
@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"
```

## üìä Phase 7: Full-Stack Dashboard Implementation

### 7.1 Complete Dashboard Development

**Production-Ready Analytics**: Building the comprehensive analytics dashboard with modern architecture.

```
Based on the table filled by the MCP server, make an analytics dashboard based on the analytic PRD with next js and express js. Use the .env for the database connection. Slight correction, no need to add authentication for the dashboard. Make all the dashboard code inside /dashboard folder
```
