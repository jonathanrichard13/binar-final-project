Q: My wearable device won't connect to the Vitalynk app, how do I troubleshoot this?
A: First, ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone and your wearable is charged above 20%. In the Vitalynk app, go to "VitalSettings" > "VitalDevices" > "Reconnect VitalDevice" and follow the pairing process through our "VitalPair" system. If connection fails, restart both devices, clear the Vitalynk app cache through "VitalCache Clear", and ensure your wearable firmware is updated. For persistent issues, try "Forget VitalDevice" and re-pair completely using our "VitalReset" protocol.

Q: The Vitalynk app crashes or freezes during health data sync, what should I do?
A: App crashes during sync usually indicate memory issues or corrupted data in our "VitalSync" system. Force-close the Vitalynk app, restart your phone, and ensure you have at least 1GB of free storage. Try syncing with a strong WiFi connection instead of cellular data through our "VitalWiFi" mode. If crashes persist, go to "VitalSettings" > "VitalData Management" > "Clear VitalSync Cache", or contact our "VitalSupport" team with your device model and crash logs from "VitalDiagnostics".

Q: Why are my heart rate readings inaccurate or missing in Vitalynk?
A: Inaccurate heart rate readings can result from improper wearable positioning, dirty sensors, excessive movement, or skin conditions affecting our "VitalPulse" monitoring system. Clean your device sensors with a soft cloth, ensure the wearable fits snugly but comfortably on your wrist, and avoid wearing it over tattoos or scars. Recalibrate by going to "VitalSettings" > "VitalDevice" > "VitalSensor Calibration" and following the 5-minute calibration process using our "VitalCalibrate" algorithm.
