Q: How do I set up family health monitoring and invite family members to Vitalynk?
A: To create a "VitalFamily Circle", upgrade to VitalPro plan and go to "VitalSettings" > "VitalFamily" > "Invite VitalMembers". Enter family members' email addresses and set their relationship (spouse, child, parent, etc.) through our "VitalRelationship" selector. They'll receive an invitation to download Vitalynk and connect their health data through our "VitalInvite" system. Children under 18 require parental consent through "VitalParent Guardian" and have restricted data sharing via our "VitalKids" protection mode.

Q: What health information can family members see and what privacy controls are available?
A: Family members can see general wellness trends (activity levels, sleep quality, weekly summaries) through the "VitalFamily Dashboard" but cannot access detailed biometric data without explicit permission via our "VitalPermission" system. You control what each family member sees through granular privacy settings in "VitalPrivacy Controls". Emergency health information and medical alerts can be shared with designated emergency contacts only through "VitalEmergency Share". Parents can monitor children's health with age-appropriate restrictions through our "VitalParental Controls".

Q: How can I remove someone from my family health circle or change their access level?
A: Go to Vitalynk app > "VitalSettings" > "VitalFamily" > "Manage VitalMembers", select the family member, and choose "Modify VitalAccess" or "Remove from VitalCircle". Removed members immediately lose access to your health data through our "VitalRevoke" system, but their own health data remains private to them. You can also temporarily pause data sharing without removing them through our "VitalPause" feature from the VitalFamily circle.
