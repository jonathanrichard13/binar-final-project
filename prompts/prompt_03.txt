you forgot the most important library, which is "mcp", below is some snippet code i used before:

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import logging

# Configure logging to output to the console (stdout)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s %(message)s")


def send_log_message(message: str):
    logging.info(message)


# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Demo")
send_log_message("Starting MCP server...")
